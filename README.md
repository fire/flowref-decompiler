# flowref

**A control-flow-aware cross-reference finder and a plausible-driven decompiler
that emits *compilable* C — over machine-code disassembly, in Lean 4.**

A linear disassembler lists instructions but won't tell you *where a value is
defined versus used*: a value is frequently built in one basic block and
consumed in another, so a straight-line scan loses the connection. `flowref`
recovers it by walking the control-flow graph and tracking values through it.
The `decompile` subcommand goes further: it lifts a whole function into a
**complete C translation unit that `gcc -fsyntax-only -std=c11` accepts**.

The defining design choice is that **every data-flow layer is driven by
[`plausible`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/plausible)
(property-based counterexample search), not by a hand-written
fixpoint / worklist / dominator algorithm.** The core trick — pose
`∀ candidate witness, ¬(it is the fact we want)` and let plausible hand back a
*counterexample* that **is** the fact — is generalised from one cross-reference
target to every use, every back-edge, every reachability query. The searches
are then **iteratively deepened** into a witness DAG (below). This is a
deliberate trade-off (see *Limitations*).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `flowref decompile <bin> <arch> <fnVaddr> <fileOff> <vaddr> <len>` | Lift a function to compilable C. |
| `flowref xref <bin> <arch> <target> <fileOff> <vaddr> <len>` | Find def→use witnesses reaching `target`. |
| `flowref <bin> <arch> <target> <fileOff> <vaddr> <len>` | Legacy positional form of `xref`. |
| `flowref --demo` | Synthetic `if` + counting-loop self-test (no disk). |
| `flowref --demo --emit-c` | Print only the C translation unit for the demo (pipe to a compiler). |
| `flowref --demo-deep` | Demonstrate iterative-deepening escalation. |
| `flowref --help` / `-h` | Full usage. |
| `flowref --version` | Version string. |

Add `--search-trace` to any analysis command to print the iterative-deepening
escalation chain to stderr.

`arch` ∈ {`x86` (32-bit), `ppc` (64-bit big-endian)}. The file offset and load
address are separate arguments because they differ in most executable formats
(sections map to addresses unrelated to their on-disk position).

## Proper C output

`decompile` (and `--demo --emit-c`) emit a self-contained C11 translation unit:

* `#include <stdint.h>` + typedefs, forward prototypes for every called
  `sub_*`, and a real `uint32_t sub_<addr>(void) { … }` definition.
* Every SSA value is declared up front as a width-typed local
  (`uint8_t`/`uint16_t`/`uint32_t`/`uint64_t`) with a C-legal name (`reg_version`).
* Memory operands become real C: `*(uint32_t*)((uintptr_t)(esi + 4))`.
* Calls become `sub_<tgt>();` (direct) or a function-pointer cast (indirect).
* SSA φ is lowered away — there is no `φ(...)` in the output; each version is a
  declared local and the value flows through plain assignments.
* Control flow is **labels + `goto`** (always valid C), with conditions built
  from the compare + branch (`if (cond_0) goto L4;`, where `cond_0` is a
  declared, documented boolean temp).

### Example — verified to compile

```bash
flowref --demo --emit-c | gcc -xc -std=c11 -w -fsyntax-only -   # exit status 0
```

produces, for the synthetic `i = 0; n = 10; while (i < n) i++; if (n == 10) r = 1;`:

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stddef.h>

uint32_t sub_1000(void) {
  uint32_t eax_0 = 0;
  uint32_t ecx_0 = 0;
  uint32_t eax = 0;
  uint32_t eax_1 = 0;
  uint32_t ebx_0 = 0;
  int cond_0 = 0;
  int cond_1 = 0;

L0:;
  eax_0 = (uint32_t)(0);
  ebx_0 = (uint32_t)(0xa);
L1:;
  cond_0 = ((int32_t)(eax_0) >= (int32_t)(ebx_0));
  if (cond_0) goto L4;
L2:;
  eax_1 = (uint32_t)(eax_0 + 1);
  goto L1;
L3:;
L4:;
  cond_1 = ((int32_t)(ebx_0) != (int32_t)(0xa));
  if (cond_1) goto L6;
L5:;
  ecx_0 = (uint32_t)(1);
L6:;
  return eax;
}
```

The counting loop (`eax_1 = eax_0 + 1`, back-edge `L2 → L1`) and the `if` on
`ebx == 0xa` are both recovered, with SSA versions, and the result compiles.

## The plausible-driven design + iterative-deepening witness DAG

Every data-flow fact is a **counterexample** to a plausible property:

* **reaching definitions / SSA:** for each `(use j, register r)` we pose
  `∀ candidate def i, ¬(i writes r ∧ a clobber-free CFG path i→…→j exists)`;
  the counterexample is the reaching def, which is wired to the use's SSA
  version (φ where several defs reach).
* **loops:** `∀ edge (b→h), ¬(h reaches b ∧ the edge exists)`; the
  counterexample is a back-edge → a loop header.

A single fixed budget cannot serve both a 10-instruction leaf and a
1000-instruction function. So each query carries a **level** `L` — a CFG-walk
step budget, a plausible `Fin N` candidate window, and a plausible instance
count. We run `L0` (cheap, shallow). If a query is *unresolved* — no witness
**and** the budget was demonstrably hit (so we cannot conclude "provably none")
— we **escalate** it to `L1`, then `L2`, up to a hard cap. This is iterative
deepening. Resolved queries never re-run; only the unresolved frontier deepens.
The escalation forms a DAG: each node's resolved result feeds dependents, and
the deepening frontier is the set of still-unresolved nodes. The chain is
recorded and printed with `--search-trace`.

This is the project's "chain of conditional witnesses that deepen based on
evidence — a witness DAG" idea, made literal (see `Flowref/Dataflow.lean`).

### Demonstration

```text
$ flowref --demo-deep
=== iterative-deepening demo: 103 insns, esi def at idx 0, use at idx 101 ===
Per-level outcome for reaching-def query (esi @ the use):
  L0 (walkSteps=64, Fin 256): UNRESOLVED (budget hit — escalate)
  L1 (walkSteps=512, Fin 1024): RESOLVED (reaching def idx [0]) plausible-found=true
  L2 (walkSteps=4000, Fin 4096): RESOLVED (reaching def idx [0]) plausible-found=true

Adaptive driver resolved esi@use at level L1 with def(s) [0].
The shallow L0 search could NOT resolve it (budget hit); deepening did.
```

The def→use path crosses 100 instructions, so the shallow L0 walk hits its step
budget and reports *unresolved*; the deepened L1 walk crosses it and resolves
the query. A purely fixed-budget search would have silently missed it.

## Build

```bash
lake update                                                  # fetch deps (incl. lean-capstone)
.lake/packages/lean-capstone/thirdparty/capstone/build.sh    # build libcapstone.a once
lake build                                                   # builds the flowref executable
```

`lean-capstone` provides the typed Capstone wrapper; its `build.sh` produces the
static `libcapstone.a` that `flowref` links. The first build is slow because
Capstone is compiled from source.

## Test

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

A single command that builds, runs the demos, pipes the emitted C through `gcc`
(both `-fsyntax-only` and `-c`), checks the iterative-deepening escalation, and
verifies error handling. It exits non-zero on any failure. CI runs the same
script (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); the cold-cache CI run is slow because it
builds Capstone from source.

## Module layout

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Flowref/Disasm.lean` | Instruction model, per-arch patterns, CFG carving (plain code). |
| `Flowref/Dataflow.lean` | Plausible-driven reaching defs + iterative-deepening DAG. |
| `Flowref/Emit.lean` | Compilable-C name/type/operand lowering. |
| `Flowref.lean` | CLI, orchestration, C emission, demos. |

## Limitations (honest scope)

This is a **lead-finder and an MVP decompiler, not Ghidra or Hex-Rays.**

- **Compiles, not semantically perfect.** The emitted C is guaranteed to parse
  and type-check as C11; it is *not* guaranteed to reproduce the original
  behaviour. Calling conventions, types, and flags are not inferred. Control
  flow is rendered with `goto` rather than fully nested `while`/`if` braces.
- **Bounded, deepening plausible search.** Every data-flow query runs plausible
  with a finite instance budget and a bounded CFG walk, escalated by iterative
  deepening up to a hard cap. Very large or obfuscated functions can still be
  slow or hit the cap — that is the deliberate trade-off of the plausible-driven
  design, chosen over classical worklist/SSA/dominator algorithms by intent.
- **Register-level, textual operand model.** Sub-register aliasing
  (`al`/`ax`/`eax`), memory SSA, and indirect/computed branches are not
  modelled; φ nodes are detected and lowered but not minimised.
- **Conservative patterns.** `defOf`/`useDisp`/`clobbers`/`writesReg` are small,
  auditable rules over Capstone's textual operands; whole-table loads and
  exotic addressing forms are not yet covered. Adding an architecture is a few
  lines in `Flowref/Disasm.lean`.
